# Crafty CQRS

A simple library to dispatch command and query to appropriate handlers.

## Only an abstraction of the [MediatR library](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)

One of the main aspect of **Domain Driven Design**, is to align the language with the domain we want to model.

Why don't we do the same for our technical architecture?

When using **Command and Query Responsability Segregation (CQRS)** pattern, we would love to have Command and Query
defined in our code base, not an implementation details `IRequest` that could be sometimes the first or the second.

This is the purpose of this library: abstract MediatR `IRequest` into `ICommand` and `IQuery`, keeping all features of this library.

## Advantages

All is about **readability** ðŸ˜Œ.

- **align the language**: stop using the "request" keyword when you are doing CQRS
- **everything is based on interfaces** (thanks to default implementation in interface) : 
  - you prefer a record for you command and your handler? Please do it, you have no limitation.
  - you want to implement multiple handling in a s~~~~ingle class? please do it. 
- **simplify**: remove `CancellationToken` from `Handle()` method.
  - most of process cannot be cancelled (or we don't want to implement a cancellation process).

## Show me code, no talk.

### Command dispatching

```csharp
ICommandDispatcher commandDispatcher = ...

await commandDispatcher.Dispatch(new RegisterUserCommand());
```

The command :
```csharp
public record RegisterUserCommand : ICommand;
```

The handler :
```csharp
public record RegisterUserCommandHandler : ICommandHandler<RegisterUserCommand>
{

    public Task Handle(RegisterUserCommand command)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Query dispatching

```csharp
IQueryDispatcher queryDispatcher = ...

await queryDispatcher.Dispatch(new ListAllRegisteredUsersQuery());
```

The query :
```csharp
public record ListAllRegisteredUsersQuery : IQuery<IEnumerable<UserListItem>>;
```

The handler :
```csharp
public record ListAllRegisteredUsersQueryHandler : IQueryHandler<ListAllRegisteredUsersQuery, IEnumerable<UserListItem>>
{

    public Task<IEnumerable<UserListItem>> Handle(ListAllRegisteredUsersQuery query)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

## And ... cancellation?

In certain case, if you want to access the CancellationToken in an handler, 
you can implement `ICommandCancellableHandler` or `IQueryCancellableHandler`, that add the token as a second parameter.

```csharp
public record RegisterUserCommandHandler : ICommandCancellableHandler<RegisterUserCommand>
{

    public Task Handle(RegisterUserCommand command, CancellationToken token)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```
